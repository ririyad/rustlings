## Rust Exercises

This is my own forked version of [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), I use it to track my progress.

### Solving Steps
---

1. Under `exercise`, there is a folder based on each topic
2. From console, run `rustlings verify` to know the immediate problem to solve
3. Each folder contain a `README` file on the topic
4. Study the topic, get hint using `rustlings hint <filename>`
5. After solving a question, run `rustlings verify` again. If the fix is correct, remove the 'I AM NOT DONE' from the code snippet
